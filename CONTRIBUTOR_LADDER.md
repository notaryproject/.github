# Notary Project Contributor Ladder

Hello! We are excited that you want to learn more about the Notary Project contributor ladder! This contributor ladder outlines the different contributor roles within the overall project, along with the responsibilities and privileges that come with them. Community members generally start at the first levels of the "ladder" and advance up it as their involvement in the project grows. Our project members are happy to help you advance up the contributor ladder.

Each of the contributor roles below is organized into lists of three types of things. "Responsibilities" are things that a contributor is expected to do, "Requirements" are qualifications a person needs to meet to be in that role, and "Privileges" are things contributors on that level are entitled to.

## Contributor

Description: A Contributor contributes directly to the project and adds value to it. Contributions need not be code. People at the Contributor level may be new contributors, or they may only contribute occasionally.

* Responsibilities include:
    * Follow the [Notary Project CoC](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
    * Follow the Notary Project [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
* Requirements (one or several of the below):
    * Report and sometimes resolve issues
    * Occasionally submit PRs
    * Contribute to the documentation
    * Show up at meetings, takes notes
    * Answer questions from other community members
    * Submit feedback on issues and PRs
    * Test releases and patches and submit reviews
    * Run or helps run events
    * Promote the project in public
* Privileges:
    * Invitations to contributor events
    * Eligible to become an Organization Member

## Organization Member

Description: An Organization Member is an established contributor who regularly participates in the project. Organization Members have privileges in both project repositories and elections, and as such are expected to act in the interests of the whole project.

An Organization Member must meet the responsibilities and has the requirements of a Contributor, plus:

* Responsibilities:
    * Continues to contribute regularly
    * Work to accomplish the tasks they volunteer to do within the project
* Qualifications:
    * Must have successful contributions to the project, including at least one of the following:
        * Have PRs merged and/or reviewed PRs,
        * Made contributions that resolved Issues
        * Or some equivalent combination or contribution
    * Must be actively contributing to at least one subproject, where the privileges of Organization Member will be beneficial
* Privileges:
    * May be assigned issues and reviews
    * Can trigger CI
    * Can drive project releases
    * Can be added as code owner for sub-projects
    * Can recommend other contributors to become Notary Project Organization Members

The process for a Contributor to become an Organization Member is as follows:

1. Any organization member can open an issue in the repo [.github](https://github.com/notaryproject/.github) to nominate a new organization member.
2. Receive "LGTM" or "+1" comments from a 50% majority of Org maintainers.

## Subproject Maintainer

Subproject Maintainer is defined in [Notary Project governance document](GOVERNANCE.md#subproject-maintainers).

## Org Maintainer

Org Maintainer is defined in [Notary Project governance document](GOVERNANCE.md#notary-project-org-maintainers).

## Inactive Member

_Members are continuously active contributors in the community._

A core principle in maintaining a healthy community is encouraging active participation. It is inevitable that people's focuses will change over time and they are not expected to be actively contributing forever.

However, being a member of one of the Notary Project organizations comes with an elevated set of permissions. These capabilities should not be used by those that are not familiar with the current state of the Notary Project.

Therefore members with an extended period away from the project with no activity will be removed from the Notary Project organizations and will be required to go through the org membership process again after re-familiarizing themselves with the current state. See the Notary Project [governance document](GOVERNANCE.md#maintainers-structure) for the guidance on inactive subproject maintainers and org maintainers.

### How inactivity is measured

Inactive members are defined as members of the Notary Project with **no** contributions across any repository within 12 months. Both coding and non-coding activities, such as meeting participation and event coordination, count as contributions. According to the Notary Project [governance document](GOVERNANCE.md), inactive subproject maintainers are defined as members of the Notary Project with **no** contributions in specific subprojects within 6 months. Inactive org maintainers are defined as members of the Notary Project with **no** contributions in any subprojects or organization within 3 months. This is measured by the CNCF [DevStats project](https://notary.devstats.cncf.io/d/8/dashboards?orgId=1&refresh=15m).

**Note:** Devstats does not take into account non-code contributions. If a non-code contributing member is accidentally removed this way, they may open an issue to quickly be re-instated.
